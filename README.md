# Dice_Board_Game_Problem

The Dice Board Game Problem challenges us to simulate a board game where players roll dice and strive to reach a target score.
The game involves multiple players taking turns rolling a dice and accumulating scores.
The first player to reach or exceed the target score wins the game.

To solve this problem, we prompt the user to input the number of players and the target score.
We then create an array to hold the scores of each player and a boolean array to track completed players.
Using recursion, we implement the game logic where each player takes turns rolling the dice. 
The game continues until a player wins or all players have completed their turns.
